# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex Navigation

- `/src`: Source code that OpenAI Codex should analyze
  - `/components`: React components that Agents.md helps OpenAI Codex understand
  - `/pages`: Next.js pages where OpenAI Codex can generate route handlers
  - `/styles`: CSS and styling conventions for OpenAI Codex to follow
  - `/utils`: Utility functions that Agents.md documents for OpenAI Codex
- `/public`: Static assets (OpenAI Codex should not modify these directly)
- `/tests`: Test files that OpenAI Codex should maintain and extend

## Coding Conventions for OpenAI Codex

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation

  You are an expert in C#, Unity, and scalable game development.

  Key Principles
  - Write clear, technical responses with precise C# and Unity examples.
  - Use Unity's built-in features and tools wherever possible to leverage its full capabilities.
  - Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow C# coding conventions and Unity best practices.
  - Use descriptive variable and function names; adhere to naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private members).
  - Structure your project in a modular way using Unity's component-based architecture to promote reusability and separation of concerns.

  C#/Unity
  - Use MonoBehaviour for script components attached to GameObjects; avoid ScriptableObjects.
  - Leverage Unity's physics engine and collision detection system for game mechanics and interactions.
  - Use Unity's Input System for handling player input across multiple platforms.
  - Utilize Unity's UI system (Canvas, UI elements) for creating user interfaces.
  - Follow the Component pattern strictly for clear separation of concerns and modularity.
  - Use Coroutines for time-based operations and asynchronous tasks within Unity's single-threaded environment.

  Error Handling and Debugging
  - Implement error handling using try-catch blocks where appropriate, especially for file I/O and network operations.
  - Use Unity's Debug class for logging and debugging (e.g., Debug.Log, Debug.LogWarning, Debug.LogError).
  - Utilize Unity's profiler and frame debugger to identify and resolve performance issues.
  - Implement custom error messages and debug visualizations to improve the development experience.
  - Use Unity's assertion system (Debug.Assert) to catch logical errors during development.

  Dependencies
  - Unity Engine
  - .NET Framework (version compatible with your Unity version)
  - Unity Asset Store packages (as needed for specific functionality)
  - Third-party plugins (carefully vetted for compatibility and performance)

  Unity-Specific Guidelines
  - Use Prefabs for reusable game objects and UI elements.
  - Keep game logic in scripts; use the Unity Editor for scene composition and initial setup.
  - Utilize Unity's animation system (Animator, Animation Clips) for character and object animations.
  - Apply Unity's built-in lighting and post-processing effects for visual enhancements.
  - Use Unity's built-in testing framework for unit testing and integration testing.
  - Leverage Unity's asset bundle system for efficient resource management and loading.
  - Use Unity's tag and layer system for object categorization and collision filtering.

  Performance Optimization
  - Use object pooling for frequently instantiated and destroyed objects.
  - Optimize draw calls by batching materials and using atlases for sprites and UI elements.
  - Implement level of detail (LOD) systems for complex 3D models to improve rendering performance.
  - Use Unity's Job System and Burst Compiler for CPU-intensive operations.
  - Optimize physics performance by using simplified collision meshes and adjusting fixed timestep.

  Key Conventions
  1. Follow Unity's component-based architecture for modular and reusable game elements.
  2. Prioritize performance optimization and memory management in every stage of development.
  3. Maintain a clear and logical project structure to enhance readability and asset management.
  
  Refer to Unity documentation and C# programming guides for best practices in scripting, game architecture, and performance optimization.
  
- Use TypeScript for all new code generated by OpenAI Codex
- OpenAI Codex should follow the existing code style in each file
- Agents.md requires meaningful variable and function names in OpenAI Codex output
- OpenAI Codex should add comments for complex logic as guided by Agents.md

### React Components Guidelines for OpenAI Codex

- OpenAI Codex should use functional components with hooks as specified in Agents.md
- Keep components generated by OpenAI Codex small and focused
- Agents.md requires proper prop typing in all OpenAI Codex component code
- OpenAI Codex must follow the file naming convention: PascalCase.tsx

### CSS/Styling Standards for OpenAI Codex

- OpenAI Codex should use Tailwind CSS for styling as documented in Agents.md
- Follow utility-first approach in all OpenAI Codex style implementations
- OpenAI Codex should use custom CSS only when necessary


## Pull Request Guidelines for OpenAI Codex

When OpenAI Codex helps create a PR, please ensure it:

1. Includes a clear description of the changes as guided by Agents.md
2. References any related issues that OpenAI Codex is addressing
3. Ensures all tests pass for code generated by OpenAI Codex
4. Includes screenshots for UI changes implemented with OpenAI Codex
5. Keeps PRs focused on a single concern as specified in Agents.md

## Programmatic Checks for OpenAI Codex

Before submitting changes generated by OpenAI Codex, run:

```bash
# Lint check for OpenAI Codex code
npm run lint

# Type check for OpenAI Codex TypeScript
npm run type-check

# Build check for OpenAI Codex implementations
npm run build
```

All checks must pass before OpenAI Codex generated code can be merged. Agents.md helps ensure OpenAI Codex follows these requirements.
